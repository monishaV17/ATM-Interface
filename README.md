**ATM Interface**

**Objective**

Create an ATM simulation system in Java that runs on a console and lets users safely access basic banking features including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction histories.  Through the simulation of actual ATM procedures, this project illustrates the concepts of object-oriented programming.

**Steps Performed**

1) Java classes for the Bank, Transaction, User, and Account databases were created and put into use.

2) Handled user ID and PIN authentication through console prompts.

3) Menu-driven features for depositing, withdrawing, transferring, and reviewing transaction history have been developed.

4) Input validation and error management were integrated for safe, intuitive operations.

5) Used sample user accounts to test the program and confirm that all ATM functions worked.

**Tools Used**

Programming Language: Java 

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

Collections: ArrayList, HashMap

Console I/O: Java Scanner class

**Outcome**

1) An interactive ATM console program that mimics actual banking processes has been successfully created.

2) The application enables verified users to examine their transaction history, make deposits and withdrawals, and move money between accounts.

3) Increased competence in object-oriented design, command-line interface creation, and Java programming.
